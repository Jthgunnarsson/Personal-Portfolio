                                    	<h1>Final Project - Silicone fingertips for a prostetic hand</h1>
									</header>
									<p>
                                        The group members of this project were <a href="https://jarlxii.github.io/Verkefni1-tf/lokaverkefni%201.html">Gunnar</a>, Jónas and <a href="https://tomy2shz.github.io/tomasjohanns/cnc.html">Tómas</a>.
                                        The goal of this project is to design and make something out of a 3-axis mill. It was available to mill out of plywood or to mill out a silicone mold with a wax cube. Another part of the project is the organization of work processes within the group.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>This project is done in parallel with another project in the Computer Controlled Hardware course, where we made a computer-controlled prosthetic device. The idea is to create silicone fingertips that can be attached to the fingers so that the hand gets more grip.
                                    </p>

                                        The goal of the project is to design and create a complete project with milling. There were two options. Either milling from a large plywood panel or milling out a silicone mold in a block of wax.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The process of making the fingertips is twofold. First, you have to make a cutter in a block of wax to make a wax mold. Next, you have to pour silicone into the wax mold then dip your finger and allow the silicone to harden. This way, the silicone fingertips will stick to the finger. After the silicone has solidified, you can remove the mold.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Throughout the design process, it is important to consider that the milling machine is vertical, so it must be kept in mind that all areas that will be milled must be accessible from above. In order to make the fingertips, five molds must be made. Four the same for the fingers and one for the thumb.
                                    </p>

                                        Jónas and Tómas had already designed the finger in their final project into a computer-controlled mechanism, Týr's Hand. But we wanted the fingertips to have more grip so to increase the area of the finger the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66_V8TveiM&ab_channel=3DCADProjects">pipe</a> function was used. The mold was designed by drawing a box around the fingertip and tilting it slightly.
                                    </p>
                                    <figure>

                                    Then the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCPm6z5zbgY&ab_channel=AutodeskFusion360">mold</a> function was used to cut out the shape of the fingertip in the mold.
                                    </p>
                                    <figure>

                                    Since we are going to put our finger into the mold after it has been cast with the silicone, there is no need to create an inlet hole for the silicone.

								    <p>
                                    Started watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTrG9jYQqc">video</a> and then followed the instructions. It was decided to use the "parallel" command only because we thought that since the object is so small it would be sufficient. It turned out to be a bad decision. We then got into trouble with the fact that not everything came out as it should have been, as seen in the pictures just below. It was as if a part was not selected for cutting, and the drill did not manage to remove all the material from the ribs.</p>
                                    
                                    <figure>

                                    <p>
                                        These two were then achieved with the following methods: Changing the selection of the area that should be milled (see the first picture to see what not to do and the second is the right thing to do), using a fillet on the edges of the ribs, see picture, to be worn an easier way to what he should mill and last but not least, using the pocket command, these three solved the problem.

                                    Then the g-code was saved as described <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ3PzItsdzg">here</a>. But when we started milling the thumb, we noticed that we had set the stepover to 0.034mm in parallel, that it was too fine and took an unnecessarily long time, so we changed the stepover to 0.7mm, which made it go from the estimated 30min to 1min according. the simulation. Before the other fingers, the stepover was 0.178mm for parallel and it took 4min, which was as it is said in English "best of both worlds" in that the milling took both a short time and was quite nice, although it didn't hurt to have the milling rough since we were making grips for fingers and then the roughness would only increase the grip.

                                    The silicone we used was a <a href="https://www.zhermack.com/public/uploads/ZH-Brochure-Industrial-EN-F800021.pdf">Zhermack ZC30 Silicone</a> and the hardener we used is called <a href="https://www.zhermack.com/public/uploads/ZH-Brochure-Industrial-EN-F800021.pdf">Zhermack ZC 120 Non Flammable Curing Agent</a>. The wet time was 30 min, at 23°C and the drying time was 72 hours. Which was both an advantage and a disadvantage. When the working time is long, it is suitable to prevent air bubbles that can form when the silicone is poured. However, the silicone takes much longer to dry, in this case 3 days! When mixing, 100/5 of silicone and hardener were used based on weight.

                                    But before it was cast, a sprayed release agent was used <a href="https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/rw4-spray-wax-release-agent">RW4</a> on the wax mold so it would be easier to release the silicone.

                                    During casting, it became clear that it was very difficult to put the silicone in such a small mold. In addition, the fingers had to lie on top of each other at an angle, which turned out to be even more difficult and required several attempts to cast. Below is a video of the process.

                                    But in the end it was possible to put the fingers on top of the mold using some leftover plywood and plenty of duct tape.

                                    The fingers came out nicely.
                                    </p>

                                    But there were two fingertips that shifted slightly and were not properly cast.
                                    </p>

                                    This happened in the casting itself, where it was very difficult to pour the silicone into the mold because the silicone was so thick and the mold was so small. Then it was very difficult to keep the fingers in the right position because the mold had a slope. (See photos in Casting)

                                    At the beginning of the project, it was set up in <a href="https://trello.com/en/login">Trello</a> with all the tasks of the project which included priority stickers along with the responsible person for each task. Trello is a very simple way to document the project team, distribute the load between team members, and have an overview of the project's results. It costs nothing, but they do offer a subscription for extra access to the site's functionality. Below you can see our Trello pages.
                                    </p>

                                    In addition, TeamGantt was achieved which allows us to use <a href="https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/template/simple-gantt-chart-4bf6b793-490f-4623-84ca-c9c6251a91fc">Gant chart</a> to monitor all tasks for each day and get a visual overview of how much time we spend on each task.

                                    To get TeamGannt, you had to go to Power-Ups on the front page of Trello and click on Add Power-Ups. From there you can reach TeamGannt by clicking on their tab. During installation, access had to be created with them.
